## What is the Pomodoro Technique? üïí

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that breaks work into intervals (traditionally 25 minutes) separated by short breaks.

The Pomodoro Technique can help maintain and improve focus, reduce procrastination, prevent burnout and increase overall productivity. 

1. **Choose a Task**: Select a task to focus on. 
3. **Work**: Focus on the task without distractions until the timer goes off. 
2. **Set the Timer**: Set a timer for 25 minutes. 
4. **Take a Break**: Take a 5-minute break. 
5. **Repeat**: Repeat steps 1-4 three more times. 
6. **Longer Break**: After four pomodoros, take a longer break of 15-30 minutes.
